# quickmemo-reformatter

Reformatting exported memos from LG QuickMemo+ to something more consumable

## Why

Notes can pile up. This is a handy script to facilitate periodic review.

## How

Use the export function built into the app. The folder
`/storage/emulated/0/QuickMemo+` will have lqm files. Copying can go faster if
the files are moved to /storage/emulated/0/DCIM and PTP is used and not MTP.

```
pushd $lqm_dir
find . -name \
  "*.lqm" -exec sh -c "basename '{}' .lqm | xargs unzip '{}' -d " \; -delete
popd
python qm_reformat.py $lqm_dir
```

## Future features (maybe)

* reasonably-named output
* save or skip note
* sort note
* edit note before saving
* graphical stuff
